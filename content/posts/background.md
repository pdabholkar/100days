Inspired by The Embedded Kitchen's [100 days of FPGA and Digital Design](https://theembeddedkitchen.net/upcoming-adventure-100-days-of-fpga-and-digital-design/1068), I decided to attempt my own 100 days of FPGA development. However, because I have already worked on FPGA designs for close to 10 years, I needed a different objective than just learn FPGA design for this exercise. Being fascinated by the field of Machine Learning, I felt it would be a good idea to document my attempts at porting existing designs and ML algorithms to FPGAs.

So here goes the next 100 days of Machine Learning and FPGA design
