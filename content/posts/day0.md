This is Day0.

Most of the day was actually spent on getting the website up on github using Hugo. As is generally the case, once you go down a rabbit hole, it is extremely difficult to find your way out. This whole idea of static pages and all being new to me meant I had a tough time following the tutorials even though they were written in a very easy to understand language. The one that finally worked for me was [this one](https://inside.getambassador.com/creating-and-deploying-your-first-hugo-site-to-github-pages-1e1f496cf88d)

To top it, I initially started with gitlab, but had trouble getting the CI/CD pipeline to work correctly and serve the webpages, even though the pipeline status was shown as *okay*
